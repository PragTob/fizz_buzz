# FizzBuzz

A solution to [FizzBuzz](https://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest) in multiple steps with some extensions. For fun and profit.

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

## Setup

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rspec spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
